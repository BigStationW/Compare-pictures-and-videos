# Compare-pictures-and-videos
Combines several images/videos into one (for comparison purposes).

On this repository, there are 3 images examples you can use for a test:
- "1. Image 1.jpg"
- "2. Image 2.jpg"
- "3. Image 3.jpg"

By double clicking on **run.bat**, you'll get a final image named **combined_image.jpg** that'll give you this result:

![combined_image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2ddfeae-d2c7-4c2b-8f37-f9d9977715f0)

It's also working for videos (and videos + images):

You can change the title [here](https://github.com/BigStationW/Compare-pictures-and-videos/blob/84460cbd278c0941f949293ba9e933315ca85b19/combine.py#L19)


## 1. Clone the repository somewhere on your PC
```git clone https://github.com/BigStationW/Compare-pictures-and-videos```


## 2. Install the required Python packages
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## 3. Your images/videos must be on the same folder as [the script](https://github.com/BigStationW/Compare-pictures/blob/main/combine.py) and the run.bat file
- Naming the files as "1. X.jpg", "2. Y.jpg" and so on tells the script the order in which the images should appear from left to right (And if you name them “1a. X.jpg,” “1b. Y.jpg,” and “2. Z.jpg,” images 1a and 1b will be stacked vertically).
- The images can be in any of the following formats: ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.bmp', '.webp']
- The videos can be in any of the following formats: ['.mp4', '.avi', '.mov', '.mkv', '.webm']
